### Realizations

* React.js on Electron is a very, very nice sounding combination theoretically.
* React's (with its development tree) single-page application is very promising inside Electron. It makes it easy because devs having to deal with data tranmission between frames.
* Turns out, developing React.js with Electron might be easier if developed seperatelly. Which is quite tedious, but atleast all of the good parts are still there.
